## The wisdom tracking logic

When a person is learning something, he is in a journey of discovery. He basically discovers 2 kinds of things:

1. Simple Entities or
2. Advanced Entities

__Simple Entity__ can include activities like learning to use APIs, high level overview of any concept, learning a language - programming or not, ideas gained from movies or articles etc. 

Whereas __Advanced Entity__ includes activities like learning calculus, understanding source codes of research architectures, any unification process, debugging issues with any software or hardwares, recreation of cutting-edge algos in any language, reading research papers, applying ideas inspired from somewhere, creation of standards or methodologies or packages etc.

Hence the consequences of learning can be one of two outcomes either __Simple Entity Discovery (SED)__ or __Advanced Entity Discovery (AED)__.

## Measuring Learning progress

From here on the standards of wisdom tracking is set using SED and AED. The wisdom tracking can be referred to as __"growth standard" (GS)__. The GS will have 3 levels, namely :

<ol type = "a">
<b>
<li> focused</li>
<li> extra-mile</li>
<li> ultra-instinct</li>
</b>
</ol>

___
## Focused : GS baseline (6 ED / day)

Focused GS will help gain minimum of 5 SEDs and 1 AEDs daily or on working days, which is a total of 6 EDs.

`At the end of a month, Focused GS will result in 6 x 6 days/week x 4 weeks/month = 144 EDs`
___
## Extra-mile : GS moderate (12 ED / day)

Extra-mile GS will help gain minimum of 10 SEDs and 2 AEDs daily or on working days, which is a total of 12 EDs.

`At the end of a month, Extra-mile GS will result in 12 x 6 days/week x 4 weeks/month = 288 EDs`
___
## Ultra-instinct : GS extreme (15 ED / day)
Ultra-instinct GS will help gain minimum of 10 SEDs and 5 AEDs daily or on working days, which is a total of 15 EDs.

`At the end of a month, Ultra-instinct GS will result in 15 x 6 days/week x 4 weeks/month = 360 EDs`
